An AI Strategy for Sweden
Kärnan av strategin är behovet av ett djärvt ledarskap som fokuserar på att skapa värde med hjälp av AI. Det krävs mersamarbete mellan samhällssektorer, och gemensamma investeringar som drivs på av internationella relationer. Både privataoch offentliga organisationer ska genom AI-användning stärka sin konkurrenskraft, lösa samhälleliga utmaningar och visavägen för andra.
Strategin är en guide för politiker, näringslivets ledningsgrupper, beslutsfattare, civilsamhällets aktörer och allaförändringsledare som har ambitionen att på ett ansvarsfullt sätt utveckla Sverige.
Using AI is necessary for solving key societal challenges, staying competitive, and in general
preserving and developing a democratic society with a high quality of life. The objective of An
AI Strategy for Sweden is therefore to develop Sweden’s capabilities to strongly benefit from
the potential of AI.
MARTIN SVENSSONMANAGING DIRECTOR, AI SWEDEN
"Based on who we are, our values, and our
strengths, Sweden has a tremendous opportunity
to solve key societal, democratic, and business
challenges with the use of AI. To get there we
should focus on generating value, leading with
boldness, scaling collaboration, and investing
significantly across sectors.."
Like many other countries, Sweden faces urgent grand challenges such as climate change,
increasing energy demand, an aging population, and threats to our democracy and security. The
consequences of the demographics alone turn the usage of AI and modern technology into a
necessity, as the welfare sector otherwise would need a significant share of the newly
graduated workforce at the same time as there are limits to tax raises. Today’s solutions are
simply not the solutions that will build the future of society.
In the private sector, many companies are seeing rapidly increasing international competition
and signs of a coming dramatic disruption, often driven by new possibilities enabled by AI. To
preserve and strengthen competitiveness, Sweden should adopt policies that spur its private
sector and, not least, large exporting corporations to accelerate their investments in AI.
Countries that early on have invested heavily in AI research and talent through research-focused
strategies (e.g. Canada) now face a crucial choice to invest beyond research and
experimentation to enable adoption or lag behind. While others have to change their strategies,
Sweden on the other hand has an opportunity to acknowledge that the benefits from AI come
when the technology is put to use in companies and organizations, and implement an adoption-
focused strategy from the beginning.

Executive Summary
Kärnan av strategin är behovet av ett djärvt ledarskap som fokuserar på att skapa värde med hjälp av AI. Det krävs mersamarbete mellan samhällssektorer, och gemensamma investeringar som drivs på av internationella relationer. Både privataoch offentliga organisationer ska genom AI-användning stärka sin konkurrenskraft, lösa samhälleliga utmaningar och visavägen för andra.
Strategin är en guide för politiker, näringslivets ledningsgrupper, beslutsfattare, civilsamhällets aktörer och allaförändringsledare som har ambitionen att på ett ansvarsfullt sätt utveckla Sverige.
Sweden should act now and apply a bold strategy aligned with democratic values, incentivizing
substantial investment by companies and organizations and aiming at generating and spreading
the benefits across sectors and society.
 An AI Strategy for Sweden, therefore, encourages Sweden to recognize the necessity of AI and
apply a fully adoption-centric strategy that ensures significant and broad value across sectors,
contributes to a prosperous democratic society, strengthens our national security, and enables
Sweden to have a positive global impact while navigating potential risks.
 The heart of such a strategy should be bold leadership focusing on value, cross-sector
collaboration, and collective investments, fueled by international relations and strong
frontrunners in both the private and public sectors boldly leading the way.
 An AI Strategy for Sweden has been written to guide politicians, business leaders, decision-
makers, civil servants, or changemakers with ambition and responsibility to lead and develop
Sweden, the Swedish ecosystem, or individual organizations and companies towards a positive
future through one of the most transformative times in history.
This first version of An AI Strategy for Sweden is intended to catalyze actions by leaders in
national and regional governments, government agencies, corporations, and public
organizations.
It can not be emphasized enough that Sweden’s success in adopting AI requires broad and
collective actions from a wide range of companies and organizations. It is not down to the
government alone, although the government plays an important role as a key enabler.
This Strategy has been developed by AI Sweden, the national center for applied AI with the
mission to Accelerate the use of AI for the benefit of our society, our competitiveness, and
everyone living in Sweden, with feedback and input from selected experts in Sweden, Canada,
USA and Singapore. The Strategy is also inspired by the strategies of EU, Canada, the USA, the UK,
Germany, and Singapore.

A future Swedish society making the most of the potential of AI should draw on existing strengths
centered around democracy, social stability, a highly developed welfare state, high levels of
equality, and a business environment that fosters innovation and entrepreneurship.
Based on who we are as a country, our values, and our strengths, the future Sweden seizes the
opportunity of AI to solve key societal and business challenges for the benefit of a prosperous
society characterized by democratic values and high quality of life. This is powered by a robust,
highly attractive, and ambitious Swedish AI ecosystem that has a positive global impact on
people and the planet.
The Vision can also be expressed as Sweden striving to become a worldwide benchmark for how
AI is embedded nationally and generates sustainable value throughout businesses and society
with a positive impact globally.
As an overall indicator of immediate progress, Sweden should aim to be ranked among the top 10
countries in the Global AI Index (current ranking is 17) by 2025, at the latest. 
A broader framework for benchmarking and measurement based on the Global AI Index and this
Strategy is suggested further down.

Fundamental standpoints & perspectives
This Strategy is based on a strong sense of urgency and an analysis summarized in a set offundamental standpoints and perspectives that must be recognized by any politician, businessleader, decision-maker, civil servant, or changemaker with ambition and responsibility to leadand develop Sweden, the Swedish ecosystem, or individual organizations and companies.
These standpoints and perspectives also underpin the heart of the strategy and the Keyprinciples.
Competitiveness | The international private sector constantly expands its lead
The last years have clearly shown that the use of AI at scale and profound breakthroughshappen in the private sector, not least in the USA. Companies with access to relevant data,resources, leadership, and talent constantly increase their lead through a positive reinforcementloop of attracting more talent, generating more value, increasing investments, attracting moretalent, and so forth.
The trend is clear, organizations and companies that understand AI the best, also increase theirinvestments the most. As a consequence, the gap between the best and laggards continues towiden. As the value and potency of AI typically scale exponentially, the importance of not fallingbehind cannot be emphasized enough.
To stay relevant, Sweden as a nation, and Swedish companies and organizations, should engageand learn from the best on all levels. Reference: HAI AI Index Report 2023
Speed | The extreme pace of AI development must be recognized and acted upon
The speed at which AI is being developed is unprecedented, recently demonstrated bygenerative AI (on language, images, and video). New services have reached hundreds of millionsof users and started to change knowledge work in an exceptionally short period of time.
This pace of change can be expected to continue and force companies and organizations toadapt. The pace of development in the private sector, where there is access to real-world dataand significant resources, also challenges academic research on AI methodologies andtechnology to stay relevant.
To stay adaptive and strengthen Sweden’s competitiveness, the Swedish AI ecosystem needs tolift to a higher level. This means that new ways of working, new incentives, new fundingprocesses, and new ways of collaborating should be identified and deployed.
As noted in the introduction, even countries that have invested in AI research and talent throughresearch-focused strategies early on(e.g. Canada) now face a crucial choice to invest beyondresearch and experimentation to enable adoption or lag behind.

Availability | General AI technology is widely available, while data is often proprietary
Mature and powerful AI technologies are already today freely available or accessible as ready-to-be-used services and tools. Although generative AI is used to substantially improve the qualityand productivity across organizations and processes, the potential value of availabletechnology is far from fully realized.
While AI technology is typically openly available, data held by companies and organizations isoften proprietary and constitutes untapped value and opportunity for strengthenedcompetitiveness and societal solutions. Hence, a strategy aiming at accelerating the use of AIbroadly should prioritize investments driving adoption and value-creation based on suchproprietary data.
In academia and research institutes, there is also an untapped potential for adopting existing AItechnologies and accelerating and enhancing research in various fields (e.g. medicine, biology,materials, etc).
As the adoption of AI happens broadly, research related to the consequences on societybecomes increasingly important. Such research could include research on the economicpotential, societal value, consequences on the labor market, and the safety of AI systems. 
Leadership | Broad AI adoption requires bold leadership
Determined and knowledgeable leadership understanding the potential value and risks of AI,setting direction, and making concrete investments is critical for any nation, organization, orcompany that wants to broadly benefit from the opportunities of AI. Lack of leadership leads tomissed opportunities and increased risks of AI being used in ways not aligned with responsible AIprinciples, not beneficial for society, or misaligned with other objectives.
Further, the competence of an organization will determine how well and sustainably AI solutionswill be built and deployed. Leaders understanding the potential of AI therefore immediately andforcefully strive to increase knowledge level and competence broadly among its leaders andworkforce in a purposeful way on a strategic, tactical, and operational level.
Lastly, investing in capabilities and competence is essential but not enough. Without a shift inmindset, those investments will not render expected returns, what took us here is not what willlead us into the future. Leaders need to have an ambidextrous approach, both workingstrategically and visionary to take the nation and organization on a long-term journey whilesimultaneously creating value and solving problems using currently available AI solutions. Thisneeds to be communicated and embodied by executive leaders and decision-makers.
8

Skills & Talent | The demand for AI skills is growing
The demand for AI skills & talent is growing, and a highly skilled workforce is a critical long-termneed of any AI ecosystem. Frontrunner nations, regions, and companies have for many yearsmade, and continue to make, significant efforts to attract, develop and train talent to build anduse AI.
The issue of skills & talent in an ecosystem is enormous, and includes education of futureworkforce on many levels, training of existing workforce (re-/upskilling), attracting and retainingtalent to the field of AI, and attracting international talent to Sweden. The responsibilities for thevarious aspects are highly distributed which needs to be considered when setting a strategy forhow to address the needs.
It’s equally important to not only focus on technical skills and talent to drive AI adoption andinitiatives. AI is a cross-disciplinary field requiring skills as well in change management,interaction design, legal, business models, communication, innovation management, and manymore context-dependent skills.
Collaboration | AI has unique properties requiring collaboration in ecosystems
Unlike many technologies, the deployment and adoption of AI technology and solutions comewith value creation and synergies across all sectors of society. Moreover, very feworganizations/companies, or even nations, can build enough capability and competencethemselves. Extensive collaboration is therefore essential and Sweden should recognize the needto invest in the building of AI ecosystems by facilitating and incentivizing collaboration.
For Sweden especially, with the high decentralization of the public sector (e.g. 21 regions, 290municipalities, 350+ government agencies), collaboration becomes even more important as veryfew organizations individually are capable of building and managing necessary infrastructure,data, and solutions. To really scale the benefits of AI across both organizations and the country,significant activities and investments compensation for the decentralization must be put in place.
“With new opportunities, risks, and threats to prosperity and security at stake, the promise and peril associatedwith this foundational technology are too vast for any single actor to manage alone. As a result, cooperation isinherently needed to equally mitigate international security risks, as well as to capitalize on the technology’spotential to transform enterprise functions, mission support, and operations.”From: An Artificial Intelligence Strategy for NATO
“The research community, industry, and Government play important, interconnected roles to enable thedevelopment and deployment of AI solutions. It is critical for Singapore to enhance partnerships acrossthese stakeholders to strengthen our collective capabilities and drive our overall national AI effort.”From: Singapore's AI Strategy

RELEVANT STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF SWEDEN
Sweden has some comparative advantages and disadvantages worth considering.
As mentioned in the Vision above, the Swedish values and strengths should be embraced andconsidered when developing an AI strategy. As a nation, Sweden is known for its social stability,highly developed welfare state, high levels of equality, a skilled workforce, and a businessenvironment that fosters innovation and entrepreneurship. Furthermore, Sweden offers acompetitive, open economy with access to new products, technologies, and innovations, a well-educated workforce, and a stable political environment.
Relative to its size, Sweden has many diverse exporting enterprises as well as a rich startupcommunity, which should mean that many companies are exposed to competitive markets andneed to be early adopters.
Sweden has also traditionally ranked high on innovation, is internationally recognized in qualitymanagement, and has a history of successfully managing change both within organizations andfor society at large. The culture of early delegation with a lack of management involvement canon the other side lead to slow AI adoption and poor prioritization.
The public sector is well organized and holds exceptionally valuable data, but is also highlydecentralized with many small organizations facing difficulties in establishing relevantleadership, attracting relevant competence, and investing according to the opportunities.Regulatory frameworks like GDPR and public procurement also lead to slower progress. Severalother sectors are also lagging for similar reasons, not least the vast number of SMEs.
The education system is divided between humanities and science. The transformation initiated byAI implies the need for more workers skilled in several fields. Sweden has few cross-disciplinaryprograms and there are few indications that this will change during the coming years.
As an EU member state, Sweden has in practice focused on regulation rather than enablinginnovation. The dynamics in the two other relevant continents, North America and Asia are clearlydifferent which has resulted in faster development.
This comparative analysis by Brookings into national AI strategies and capabilities pointstowards Sweden having weakness in data management and algorithmic management andlacking focus on adoption in both industry and public services.

AI AND CURRENT INVESTMENTS IN SWEDEN
Early 2024 the Swedish AI ecosystem is well prepared and Sweden stands a good chance tobenefit from AI. The Swedish private sector is highly diverse, has a strong track record of beinginnovative, and includes several significant frontrunners. The interest in AI and the collaborativespirit in the public sector are quickly growing and good examples of valuable solutions are beingdeployed. The combination of WASP’s investment in academic research and talent, and AISweden's dedicated effort to driving adoption across sectors, is from what we can see a uniquestrength that few countries can match.
However, larger investments in Sweden are necessary. Research and development (R&D) is a keydriver of digital innovation, and according to OECD Going Digital, R&D expenditure in informationindustries in Sweden is a lagging indicator.
While the Swedish Innovation Agency, Vinnova, is making important resources available, it isnotable that the Swedish Government has not made any new dedicated investments in AI duringthe last six years, in stark contrast to other leading countries such as Canada, Singapore, the UK,France, and Germany.
For reference, one of the most relevant countries for Sweden to collaborate with, is Canadawhere between 2022 and 2023, $2.57 billion was invested in AI research in the country, as total AIinvestment reached $8.64 billion. Read more here.

GLOBAL RANKING
According to the Global AI Index Sweden ranks number 17 in total, and as follows in the sevencategories:Talent - 15 Infrastructure - 21 Operating Environment - 2Research - 13Development - 17Government Strategy - 44Commercial - 16 
What stands out is the lack of Government Strategy.
Tortoise Media’s Global AI Index is one of the most established global benchmarks for countriesand encompasses several important metrics and data. 
Sweden is currently ranked 17 out of 62 countries, most notable is that we rank 44th in thecategory “Governmental Strategy”. Looking at the metrics for Government Strategy, thefollowing conclusions can be drawn:Developing and adopting a national strategy will significantly increase our positionThe strategy should have dedicated funding, include elements of reskilling and up-skillingInvolvement by senior government members or ministers gives increasingly high points

As set out in the Executive summary, An AI Strategy for Sweden encourages Sweden to recognizethe necessity of AI and apply a fully adoption-centric strategy that ensures significant and broadvalue across sectors, contributes to a prosperous democratic society, strengthens our nationalsecurity, and enables Sweden to have a positive global impact while navigating potential risks.
The heart of this adoption-centric strategy should be bold leadership focusing on value-creation,cross-sector collaboration, and collective investments, fueled by international relations andstrong frontrunners in both the private and public sectors boldly leading the way.
To guide politicians, business leaders, decision-makers, civil servants, and changemakers, thestrategy includes a mindset that should permeate,guide, and align actions, investments, andinitiatives associated with this strategy.
The mindset is set out in the form of the followingKey Principles.
Relevant actions, investments, and objectivesshould be based on and mapped against theseprinciples for Sweden to quickly see positiveeffects and over time maximize the long-termimpact throughout the ecosystem.
The Key Principles should apply generally butmight need adjustment to fit a specific context orleadership role.
Enable the best to perform and incentivize them to share generously 
Ambitious frontrunners, i.e. the early adopters and leading companies and organizationsinvesting and demonstrating real value by AI, already exist in both private and public sectors.
Such frontrunners should be recognized, enabled, and incentivized to move even faster andgenerate more value given that they share generously with others in the ecosystem. This wouldresult in Sweden quickly reinforcing a pay-it-forward culture encouraging responsibility,investments, talent attraction, and collaboration, as well as contributing to making Sweden aglobal example of how to create substantial value through AI adoption.
This strategy's focus on frontrunners is based on the trend that breakthroughs typically appear incompanies and sectors where AI is applied to real problems, often in service and productdevelopment.

The heart of the strategy & Key principles

Engage with and learn from the best
Given the pace of development internationally and that many of the objectives are bestmanaged on an international level, Sweden as a nation as well as organizations and companiesshould actively seek partnerships with like-minded countries, leading companies, academia andresearch institutes, and non-profit organizations, where there is a ground for mutual learning anddevelopment.
Sweden and Swedish companies should especially build relations with leading global companiesand ensure access to knowledge, infrastructure, foundational models, services, and productscritical for the development and deployment of AI solutions.
International collaboration is often challenging and generating actual, mutual, and sustainablevalue takes time. Sweden’s investments in international collaborations should thereforepreferably be pragmatic, focused and strive towards a high density of interactions with selectedecosystems.
Moreover, it should be mentioned that international collaboration must be developedconsidering the current geopolitical, trade, security, and competitive situation. This can bedifficult to manage on an organizational level, and government guidance and facilitation shouldbe provided.
Substantially invest in skills and talent everywhere in the ecosystem
Leaders throughout society should invest in upskilling their workforce and attracting new talentto their respective organizations, whether that is within government, private companies, publicorganizations, ministries, government agencies, or academia.
For Sweden as a nation, dedicated efforts are necessary on many fronts, not least
Education of future workforce on many levels and in all fields,Training of existing workforce (re-/upskilling) including all professional roles relevant to AIadoption (e.g. leaders, changemakers, legal experts, AI practitioners, and domain experts).Attracting talent to the field of AIAttracting international talent to Sweden
From a governmental perspective, this represents a significant challenge. Clear direction andcoordination of the entire educational system should be prioritized as well as investments toscale initiatives quickly increasing the overall competence in the ecosystem.
In parallel, Sweden must make it easier for international talent to discover, arrive, study, work,live, and remain in Sweden, as well as incentivize and enable the private and public sectors torecruit talent internationally.
14

Invest in strategic knowledge, technology, and solutions shared by many
The development of strategic and important knowledge, technology, and solutions forsovereignty, independence, and scaled adoption should be incentivized and built-in broadcollaborations, and made available as widely as possible. Strategic knowledge, technology,and solutions (and other relevant resources) must evolve and should include nationalcomputational infrastructure, foundational models, privacy-preserving methods, access todata, data-sharing mechanisms and structures, and AI adoption tools for leaders.
AI Sweden (among others) has demonstrated that the willingness among international andSwedish companies and organizations to jointly invest in knowledge, technology, and solutionsenabling the adoption of AI is significant. When incentivized by government funding andstructured on a truly collaborative basis with strong sharing mechanisms, the return oninvestment can be significant.
Furthermore, to fully benefit from AI, strategic investments addressing specific sectors’underlying prerequisites are necessary. This specifically applies to the public sector, whereinvestments in digitalization, data platforms, and data governance are still required.
Ensure responsible use and good governance
By building on the Swedish values centered around democracy, inclusion, transparency, anddiversity, Sweden has the opportunity to scale and govern the use of AI in a responsible way. AIsystems should be designed, operated, and governed in a manner that respects laws, humanrights, values, and cultural diversity. This includes mitigating risks such as bias anddiscrimination, as well as risks related to security and safety.
As a principle, responsible use of AI should be approached and ensured by activeexperimentation and exploration while developing AI solutions in practice, and by fullyrecognizing the need for diversity and inclusion of stakeholders, domain experts, end users, andAI developers in all parts of the process.
Moreover, leaders in any organization should ensure that employees have access to, andproficiency in, available modern tools independent of for example their age, native language,disabilities, educational background, or where they live in Sweden. Related to AI, this extends toproviding prerequisites for everyone to use AI responsibly and minimize the risks that groups ofpeople are left behind.
Responsible use of AI also means that we have a responsibility to use AI where appropriate andto address our time’s most pressing global challenges.

Invest in strategic knowledge, technology, and solutions shared by many
To maximize the benefits of AI, Sweden should scale initiatives that catalyze collaboration acrossall sectors and regions. This should include a strong ambition to compensate for the highdecentralization of the public sector through investments in collaboration and sharing betweensimilar public organizations.
Facilitation of collaboration should include incentives for consortiums to build joint advancedsolutions, structures, and ways to enable access to real-world data and in general build onmechanisms that allow fast pace and adaptivity.
Sweden should also consider investing in one or two “moonshots”, e.g. large-scale initiativeswhere many actors come together to solve a grand challenge.
16

An AI strategy for Sweden points to Sweden’s opportunity to use AI to solve key societal andbusiness challenges for the benefit of a prosperous society characterized by democratic valuesand high quality of life.
As stated in the Vision, Sweden should strive towards becoming a worldwide benchmark for howAI is embedded nationally and generates sustainable value throughout businesses and societywith a positive impact globally. What would constitute such a worldwide benchmark that caninspire others to follow?
Ultimately the benchmark must demonstrate that real value is generated broadly throughoutsociety. Measuring only enabling factors, the size of investments, or the progress in some sectorswould not be enough.
Existing frameworks (for example the Global AI index ) are mainly focused on enablers for AI suchas talent, infrastructure, and innovation (research and development) and to some degreeinvestments. These could serve as indicators of use and adoption, but will not provide a holisticview.
To follow up on Sweden’s progress, a framework combining existing well-established indicatorsand additional indicators to further measure the actual use and value creation is thereforerelevant. There are few established metrics for use and value creation and such indicators needto be further developed.
More work is required to develop a pragmatic and detailed framework of indicators, but thefollowing high-level structure of three main pillars is suggested
Enablers - the status of necessary prerequisites for broad adoptionInvestments - the level of investments of various types Use and value creation - quantification of solutions deployed and the estimated value
Benchmark and measurement
ENABLERSFundamental prerequisites for broad adoption in a country, sector, or organization include operatingenvironment, access to talent and competence, infrastructure and other relevant technology, and solutions.Examples of indicators:Many of the necessary indicators are covered by the Global AI Index, such as number of graduates, datascientists, diversity of AI workforce, computing capabilities, and more. In addition, indicators covering the level of cross-sector collaboration, level of international collaboration,access to crucial knowledge, infrastructure and supercomputing capabilities, data sharing and open datasources, and foundational models for development and deployment should be added to the framework.
17

INVESTMENTSIndicators related to investments are very relevant as they both give a perspective on the belief in the futurevalue to be realized, but also serve as a proxy for the current leadership commitment regardless of level.Metrics should be on government investments as well as investments on a sector level.Given the importance of collaboration, the framework of indicators should also measure investments in cross-sector collaboration, and international collaboration as well as investments in knowledge, technology, data,and solutions related to sovereignty, independence, and scaled adoption.Examples of indicators:Many but not all of the requirements are covered by the Global AI Index. The level of the government's actualAI spending and targets, the scale, funding, and volume of business investments are partly covered. Indicatorsto be added are for instance investments by public organizations, international companies' engagement andinvestments in Sweden, and Swedish organizations' investments in competence transfer and internationalrelations.
USE AND VALUE CREATIONAn adoption-focused strategy needs indicators of actual use and value creation. Further development isneeded to measure the ecosystem at large concerning use and value creation specifically by frontrunners persector and in total. As value and impact created by AI can be direct or indirect, proxy indicators such as thenumber of AI models or solutions deployed might be relevant.Examples of indicators:Few indicators of use are covered by Global AI index beyond investments and personnel capacity however,one indicator is companies implementing AI as a key part of their business process.Indicators to be added are for example, public organizations implementing AI as a key part of their operations,the number of deployed AI models among selected organizations (frontrunners), organizations investments inAI deployment, indicators of value creation, and number of employees with access to AI tools.
Going forward, a framework and its indicators need to be further defined, specifically indicatorson Use and value creation. Preferably indicators should be developed to match already publiclyavailable data. A first step would be to measure the current state of the Swedish AI ecosystemwith regard to the developed framework and set up tracking mechanisms to follow the progress.
As an overall and immediate objective, Sweden should aim to be ranked among the top 10countries by 2025 at the latest.
18

An AI Strategy for Sweden is AI Sweden's suggested common ground for continued discussionand action. So what does the journey to a defined and adopted national strategy with clearpriorities, investments, and allocated responsibilities look like?
As it addresses a vast number of leaders throughout business and society, this journey is bothhighly important and challenging.
Therefore, let’s agree that it is our actual ability to take action that determines the progress, notthe choice of words. It is our firm belief that bold actions guided by this strategy will propel ustowards the suggested Vision.
Passivity is coupled with great risks in terms of diminished competitiveness, less tax revenue,highly qualified jobs being created elsewhere, an overburdened public sector, and an overallsignificantly less prosperous society.
On the other hand, if we succeed in taking action throughout society, we are looking at vastopportunities in attracting talent and foreign investments, increasing tax revenues, creatinghighly skilled jobs, providing excellent service and welfare for our inhabitants, and creating a keyfoundation for a prosperous future.
Roadmap ahead | Open invitation to act
We think that a few key questions will further aid us in making priorities, taking concrete action,and distributing responsibilities. As a country or as an organization, what are our priorities and what is the potential value wecould generate? What investments are necessary at what level to address those priorities and realize thevalue? What leadership, structures for collaboration, and incentives would enable the public sector tocollectively invest in solutions for the future? What needs to happen to allow Swedish healthcare to build life-saving solutions for patientsand solutions to increase the healthcare system’s productivity?What policies do we need to make it easier to attract international talent and investments?How does Sweden identify, manage, and future-proof its top priorities and distribute thebenefits? Does the government need a dedicated long-term national task force?Again, it's worth emphasizing that Sweden’s success requires bold leadership, broadcollaboration, and significant investments. Individual organizations or companies might prevailon their own, but for a prosperous Sweden, no entity, or the government for that matter can carrythe responsibility alone.
The above questions are formulated for the national level, the government being a key enabler,and similar questions will be equally important for a hospital, municipality, or companymanagement to answer and act upon.
